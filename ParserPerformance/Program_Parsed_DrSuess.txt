Theodor Seuss "Ted" Geisel was an American children's author, political cartoonist, illustrator, poet, animator, screenwriter, and filmmaker.| He is known for his work writing and illustrating more than 60 books under the pen name Dr. Seuss.| His work includes many of the most popular children's books of all time, selling over 600 million copies and being translated into more than 20 languages by the time of his death.|
Geisel adopted the name "Dr. Seuss" as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College and as a graduate student at Lincoln College, Oxford.| He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for Vanity Fair, Life, and various other publications.| He also worked as an illustrator for advertising campaigns, most notably for FLIT and Standard Oil, and as a political cartoonist for the New York newspaper PM.| He published his first children's book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street in 1937.| During World War II, he took a brief hiatus from children's literature to illustrate political cartoons, and he also worked in the animation and film department of the United States Army where he wrote, produced or animated many productions – both live-action and animated – including Design for Death, which later won the 1947 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.|
After the war, Geisel returned to writing children's books, writing classics like If I Ran the Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a Who! (1955), If I Ran the Circus (1956), The Cat in the Hat (1957), How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957), and Green Eggs and Ham (1960).| He published over 60 books during his career, which have spawned numerous adaptations, including 11 television specials, five feature films, a Broadway musical, and four television series.|
Geisel won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958 for Horton Hatches the Egg and again in 1961 for And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street.| Geisel's birthday, March 2, has been adopted as the annual date for National Read Across America Day, an initiative on reading created by the National Education Association.|
Early years
Geisel was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (née Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel.| His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A.| Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition.| Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in his first children's book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, is near his boyhood home on Fairfield Street.| The family was of German descent, and Geisel and his sister Marnie experienced anti-German prejudice from other children following the outbreak of World War I in 1914.|
Geisel attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1925.| At Dartmouth, he joined the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and the humor magazine Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern, eventually rising to the rank of editor-in-chief.| While at Dartmouth, he was caught drinking gin with nine friends in his room.| At the time, the possession and consumption of alcohol was illegal under Prohibition laws, which remained in place between 1920 and 1933.| As a result of this infraction, Dean Craven Laycock insisted that Geisel resign from all extracurricular activities, including the Jack-O-Lantern.| To continue working on the magazine without the administration's knowledge, Geisel began signing his work with the pen name "Seuss".| He was encouraged in his writing by professor of rhetoric W.| Benfield Pressey, whom he described as his "big inspiration for writing" at Dartmouth.|
Upon graduating from Dartmouth, he entered Lincoln College, Oxford, intending to earn a D.|Phil. in English literature.| At Oxford, he met Helen Palmer, who encouraged him to give up becoming an English teacher in favor of pursuing drawing as a career.| She later recalled that "Ted's notebooks were always filled with these fabulous animals.| So I set to work diverting him; here was a man who could draw such pictures; he should be earning a living doing that."|
Early career
Geisel left Oxford without earning a degree and returned to the United States in February 1927, where he immediately began submitting writings and drawings to magazines, book publishers, and advertising agencies.| Making use of his time in Europe, he pitched a series of cartoons called Eminent Europeans to Life magazine, but the magazine passed on it.| His first nationally published cartoon appeared in the July 16, 1927, issue of The Saturday Evening Post.| This single $25 sale encouraged Geisel to move from Springfield to New York City.| Later that year, Geisel accepted a job as writer and illustrator at the humor magazine Judge, and he felt financially stable enough to marry Helen.| His first cartoon for Judge appeared on October 22, 1927, and the Geisels were married on November 29.| Geisel's first work signed "Dr. Seuss" was published in Judge about six months after he started working there.|
In early 1928, one of Geisel's cartoons for Judge mentioned Flit, a common bug spray at the time manufactured by Standard Oil of New Jersey.| According to Geisel, the wife of an advertising executive in charge of advertising Flit saw Geisel's cartoon at a hairdresser's and urged her husband to sign him.| Geisel's first Flit ad appeared on May 31, 1928, and the campaign continued sporadically until 1941.| The campaign's catchphrase "Quick, Henry, the Flit!" became a part of popular culture.| It spawned a song and was used as a punch line for comedians such as Fred Allen and Jack Benny.| As Geisel gained notoriety for the Flit campaign, his work was in demand and began to appear regularly in magazines such as Life, Liberty, and Vanity Fair.|
The money Geisel earned from his advertising work and magazine submissions made him wealthier than even his most successful Dartmouth classmates.| The increased income allowed the Geisels to move to better quarters and to socialize in higher social circles.| They became friends with the wealthy family of banker Frank A.| Vanderlip.| They also traveled extensively: by 1936, Geisel and his wife had visited 30 countries together.| They did not have children, neither kept regular office hours, and they had ample money.| Geisel also felt that traveling helped his creativity.|
Geisel's success with the Flit campaign led to more advertising work, including for other Standard Oil products like Essomarine boat fuel and Essolube Motor Oil and for other companies like the Ford Motor Company, NBC Radio Network, and Holly Sugar.| His first foray into books, Boners, a collection of children's sayings that he illustrated, was published by Viking Press in 1931.| It topped The New York Times non-fiction bestseller list and led to a sequel, More Boners, published the same year.| Encouraged by the books' sales and positive critical reception, Geisel wrote and illustrated an ABC book featuring "very strange animals" that failed to interest publishers.|
In 1936, Geisel and his wife were returning from an ocean voyage to Europe when the rhythm of the ship's engines inspired the poem that became his first children's book: And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street.| Based on Geisel's varied accounts, the book was rejected by between 20 and 43 publishers.| According to Geisel, he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter with an old Dartmouth classmate led to its publication by Vanguard Press.| Geisel wrote four more books before the US entered World War II.| This included The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins in 1938, as well as The King's Stilts and The Seven Lady Godivas in 1939, all of which were in prose, atypically for him.| This was followed by Horton Hatches the Egg in 1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.|
World War II–era work
As World War II began, Geisel turned to political cartoons, drawing over 400 in two years as editorial cartoonist for the left-leaning New York City daily newspaper, PM.[37] Geisel's political cartoons, later published in Dr. Seuss Goes to War, denounced Hitler and Mussolini and were highly critical of non-interventionists ("isolationists"), most notably Charles Lindbergh, who opposed US entry into the war.| One cartoon depicted Japanese Americans being handed TNT after a "call from home", while other cartoons deplored the racism at home against Jews and blacks that harmed the war effort.[40][41] His cartoons were strongly supportive of President Roosevelt's handling of the war, combining the usual exhortations to ration and contribute to the war effort with frequent attacks on Congress[42] (especially the Republican Party), parts of the press (such as the New York Daily News, Chicago Tribune, and Washington Times-Herald), and others for criticism of Roosevelt, criticism of aid to the Soviet Union, investigation of suspected Communists,[47] and other offences that he depicted as leading to disunity and helping the Nazis, intentionally or inadvertently.|
In 1942, Geisel turned his energies to direct support of the U.|S. war effort.| First, he worked drawing posters for the Treasury Department and the War Production Board.| Then, in 1943, he joined the Army as a Captain and was commander of the Animation Department of the First Motion Picture Unit of the United States Army Air Forces, where he wrote films that included Your Job in Germany, a 1945 propaganda film about peace in Europe after World War II; Our Job in Japan; and the Private Snafu series of adult army training films.| While in the Army, he was awarded the Legion of Merit.| Our Job in Japan became the basis for the commercially released film Design for Death (1947), a study of Japanese culture that won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.| Gerald McBoing-Boing (1950) was based on an original story by Seuss and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.|
Later years
After the war, Geisel and his wife moved to La Jolla, California, where he returned to writing children's books.| He published most of his books through Random House in North America and William Collins, Sons (later HarperCollins) internationally.| He wrote many, including such favorites as If I Ran the Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a Who! (1955), If I Ran the Circus (1956), The Cat in the Hat (1957), How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957), and Green Eggs and Ham (1960).| He received numerous awards throughout his career, but he won neither the Caldecott Medal nor the Newbery Medal.| Three of his titles from this period were, however, chosen as Caldecott runners-up (now referred to as Caldecott Honor books): McElligot's Pool (1947), Bartholomew and the Oobleck (1949), and If I Ran the Zoo (1950).| Dr. Seuss also wrote the musical and fantasy film The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T., which was released in 1953.| The movie was a critical and financial failure, and Geisel never attempted another feature film.| During the 1950s, he also published a number of illustrated short stories, mostly in Redbook Magazine.| Some of these were later collected (in volumes such as The Sneetches and Other Stories) or reworked into independent books (If I Ran the Zoo).| A number have never been reprinted since their original appearances.|
In May 1954, Life magazine published a report on illiteracy among school children which concluded that children were not learning to read because their books were boring.| William Ellsworth Spaulding was the director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin (he later became its chairman), and he compiled a list of 348 words that he felt were important for first-graders to recognize.| He asked Geisel to cut the list to 250 words and to write a book using only those words.| Spaulding challenged Geisel to "bring back a book children can't put down".| Nine months later, Geisel completed The Cat in the Hat, using 236 of the words given to him.| It retained the drawing style, verse rhythms, and all the imaginative power of Geisel's earlier works but, because of its simplified vocabulary, it could be read by beginning readers.| The Cat in the Hat and subsequent books written for young children achieved significant international success and they remain very popular today.| For example, in 2009, Green Eggs and Ham sold 540,000 copies, The Cat in the Hat sold 452,000 copies, and One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish (1960) sold 409,000 copies — all outselling the majority of newly published children's books.|
Geisel went on to write many other children's books, both in his new simplified-vocabulary manner (sold as Beginner Books) and in his older, more elaborate style.|
In 1956, Dartmouth awarded Geisel with an honorary doctorate, finally legitimizing the "Dr." in his pen name.|
On April 28, 1958, Geisel appeared on an episode of the panel game show To Tell the Truth.|
Geisel's wife Helen had a long struggle with illnesses.| On October 23, 1967, Helen died by suicide; Geisel married Audrey Dimond on June 21, 1968.| Although he devoted most of his life to writing children's books, Geisel had no children of his own, saying of children: "You have 'em; I'll entertain 'em."| Dimond added that Geisel "lived his whole life without children and he was very happy without children."| Audrey oversaw Geisel's estate until her death on December 19, 2018, at the age of 97.|
Geisel was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.|H.|D.) from Whittier College in 1980.| He also received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal from the professional children's librarians in 1980, recognizing his "substantial and lasting contributions to children's literature".| At the time, it was awarded every five years.[58] He won a special Pulitzer Prize in 1984 citing his "contribution over nearly half a century to the education and enjoyment of America's children and their parents".|
Illness, death, and posthumous honors
Geisel died of cancer on September 24, 1991, at his home in La Jolla, California, at the age of 87.| His ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.| On December 1, 1995, four years after his death, University of California, San Diego's University Library Building was renamed Geisel Library in honor of Geisel and Audrey for the generous contributions that they made to the library and their devotion to improving literacy.|
While Geisel was living in La Jolla, the United States Postal Service and others frequently confused him with fellow La Jolla resident Dr. Hans Suess, a noted nuclear physicist.|
In 2002, the Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden opened in Springfield, Massachusetts, featuring sculptures of Geisel and of many of his characters.| In 2008 he was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.| On March 2, 2009, the Web search engine Google temporarily changed its logo to commemorate Geisel's birthday (a practice that it often performs for various holidays and events).|
In 2004, U.|S. children's librarians established the annual Theodor Seuss Geisel Award to recognize "the most distinguished American book for beginning readers published in English in the United States during the preceding year".| It should "demonstrate creativity and imagination to engage children in reading" from pre-kindergarten to second grade.|
At Geisel's alma mater of Dartmouth, more than 90 percent of incoming first-year students participate in pre-matriculation trips run by the Dartmouth Outing Club into the New Hampshire wilderness.| It is traditional for students returning from the trips to stay overnight at Dartmouth's Moosilauke Ravine Lodge, where they are served green eggs for breakfast.| On April 4, 2012, the Dartmouth Medical School was renamed the Audrey and Theodor Geisel School of Medicine in honor of their many years of generosity to the college.|
Dr. Seuss's honors include two Academy Awards, two Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal, and the Pulitzer Prize.|
Dr. Seuss has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at the 6500 block of Hollywood Boulevard.
